/**
 * Your story You've always loved both Fizz Buzz katas and cuckoo clocks, and
 * when you walked by a garage sale and saw an ornate cuckoo clock with a
 * missing pendulum, and a "Beyond-Ultimate Raspberry Pi Starter Kit" filled
 * with all sorts of sensors and motors and other components, it's like you were
 * suddenly hit by a beam of light and knew that it was your mission to combine
 * the two to create a computerized Fizz Buzz cuckoo clock!
 * You took them home and set up shop on the kitchen table, getting more and
 * more excited as you got everything working together just perfectly. Soon the
 * only task remaining was to write a function to select from the sounds you had
 * recorded depending on what time it was:
 * Your plan 
 * When a minute is evenly divisible by three, the clock will say the
 * word "Fizz". 
 * When a minute is evenly divisible by five, the clock will say
 * the word "Buzz". 
 * When a minute is evenly divisible by both, the clock will
 * say "Fizz Buzz", with two exceptions: 
 * On the hour, instead of "Fizz Buzz", the clock door will open, 
 * and the cuckoo bird will come out and "Cuckoo" between one and twelve times depending on the hour. 
 * On the half hour, instead of "Fizz Buzz", the clock door will open, 
 * and the cuckoo will come out and "Cuckoo" just once. 
 * With minutes that are not evenly divisible by either
 * three or five, at first you had intended to have the clock just say the
 * numbers ala Fizz Buzz, but then you decided at least for version 1.0 to just
 * have the clock make a quiet, subtle "tick" sound for a little more clock
 * nature and a little less noise. 
 * Your input will be a string containing hour
 * and minute values in 24-hour time, separated by a colon, and with leading
 * zeros. For example, 1:34 pm would be "13:34".
 * Your return value will be a string containing the combination of Fizz, Buzz,
 * Cuckoo, and/or tick sounds that the clock needs to make at that time,
 * separated by spaces. Note that although the input is in 24-hour time, cuckoo
 * clocks' cuckoos are in 12-hour time.
 * Some examples 
 * "13:34" "tick" 
 * "21:00" "Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo" 
 * "11:15" "Fizz Buzz" 
 * "03:03" "Fizz" 
 * "14:30" "Cuckoo" 
 * "08:55" "Buzz" 
 * "00:00" "Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo" 
 * "12:00" "Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo"
